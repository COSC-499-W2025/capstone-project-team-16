### Type of Tasks Worked On

* Database design and implementation
* Backend integration for data persistence
* Troubleshooting MySQL connection and authentication issues
* Environment setup and dependency management (`venv`, pip, MySQL connector)
* Schema creation and initial testing of CRUD operations

---

### Recap of Week's Goals

* Design and implement a robust database schema for project data storage.
* Integrate the database with the Python backend to enable data persistence.
* Verify that users and projects can be created, stored, and retrieved successfully.
* Establish a local MySQL development environment and resolve configuration issues.

---

### Features Assigned (Project Plan)

* **Database Integration:** Implement a MySQL backend with auto-creation and initialization logic.
* **Persistence Layer:** Replace placeholder storage logic with a functional `database_raw.py` script.
* **Schema Definition:** Create a `schema.sql` file outlining table structures and relationships.

### Completed/In-Progress Tasks (Last 2 Weeks)

* Completed: `schema.sql` design and creation.
* Completed: Implementation of `database_raw.py` with connection handling and CRUD operations.

### Additional Context (Optional)

This week focused on backend persistence and setup reliability. Several issues with MySQL authentication and permissions were resolved through iterative debugging, resulting in a stable connection workflow.
Next steps include expanding the schema for advanced project metrics and integrating the backend with the upcoming REST API layer.
