#### **2\. Scenarios & Tasks** 

**User Group: Developer / General User**

1. **First-Time Setup:** Launch the application. Read the welcome message and accept the user consent agreement to proceed to the main menu.  
2. **Standard Scan:** You want to analyze a project to see what languages are inside. Select "Run a new scan," choose "Standard" mode, and select the sample project folder provided on your desktop.  
3. **Advanced Configuration:** You want a deeper analysis. Run a **new** scan, but this time select "Advanced" mode. When prompted, try to enable specific filters (like ignoring comments or specific file types) if the options are presented.  
4. **Review Results:** You finished scanning. Navigate to the "Scan Manager" to verify that your recent scans were saved successfully.  
5. **Generate Artifact:** You are applying for a job. Inside the "Scan Manager," select one of your scans and generate a "Resume" from the data.  
6. **Cleanup:** You realized you scanned the wrong folder earlier. Find the "Delete" option within the Scan Manager and remove the incorrect scan entry.  
7. **Exit:** You are done for the day. Navigate back to the home screen and exit the program gracefully.

#### **3\. Questionnaire** 

1. On a scale of 1-5, how clear were the navigation instructions (e.g., knowing when to type a number vs. press Enter)?  
2. Did the "Advanced" mode options make sense to you, or was the terminology confusing?  
3. When you generated the resume, was the output what you expected?  
4. What is one piece of data you wish the tool had extracted from your code that it missed?  
5. Any other suggestions?
