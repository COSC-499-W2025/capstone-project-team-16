Navigate to your root directory (for me it's cd /d E:\COSC499\capstone-project-team-16)

Docker isn't really realistic to use for the core functionality without poking a ton of holes,
not sure how that wasn't caught earlier. Eventually for final submission probably best to package this as an EXE
(For now, have to have python and pytest installed)

To run tests : 

pip install pytest (first run only, if you don't already have it)

set PYTHONPATH=src;%PYTHONPATH%  (Python doesn't know your code is in src/ folder unless you tell it)
pytest tests\ -v

To run CLI : 

set PYTHONPATH=src;%PYTHONPATH%
python src\main.py

Change from PROD and DEV on line 63 in main.py to test using mocks

test_project.zip is in the root (your_path\capstone-project-team-16\test_project.zip)
(as a testing zip for when CLI prompts for a path)
